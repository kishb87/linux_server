# Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Project 5:
# Linux Server Configuration

## PROJECT INFO

The final project of the Udacity Fullnanodegree Nanodegree requires a properly configured Ubuntu server with Apache2 in order to serve the Flask application that was created in Project 3.

The application can be accessed with the following URL: http://ec2-54-201-79-86.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

The following packages were installed: PostgreSQL, Apache2, Flask, and mod_wsgi.

## ACCESSING THE SERVER

Server must be accessed using ssh at port 2200. The server ip is the following: 54.201.79.86. Login requires key-based RSA authentication which the grader for this project will have in possession.
